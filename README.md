# travian-bot

I have always wanted to play Travian, but filling up the build queue can overtake your life. I'd love if there was a way to "accumulate time", but in its absence, this is the attempt.

Edit config.json and get bot-ting. See [package.lisp](./package.lisp) for the API.

PS: No warranties if the account gets banned. But if it does, you should raise a complaint at undetected-chromedriver.

## Non-lisp dependencies

- Selenium
- Google Chrome
- [undetected-chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver)
